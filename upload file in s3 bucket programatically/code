now after running the APP2.py in terminal copy the flask server web address and paste in postman 
with post method and upload a file in form data from body option and click on send button.
we should get the output as file uploaded successfully.
now login into your AWS account in which you gave the access key and secret access key and go to s3 bucket page in AWS console there
we should see the newly created s3 bucket and a file which we uploaded in postman will reflect here.

so by this program we have connected and created AWS s3 bucket programatically and uploaded a file into it through flask API.
